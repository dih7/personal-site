## Currently

I currently live and work in Cardiff.

I graduated from Aberystwyth University in 2015, with a degree in Open Source Computing. This covered a large range of programming languages, from C, Ruby, Java and the web technologies that I use daily. My degree certainly reinforced my positive outlook on web development. 

## Other

Outside of work and the usual duties, I like to play PC games, catch up on the latest technologies and drink coffee.

REcently, I've started playing around with VR.
