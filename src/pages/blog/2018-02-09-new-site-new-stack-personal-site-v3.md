## It's that time again - welcome to the latest version of my personal site.

For some reason I seem to be unable to leave my site alone for more than a year (give or take a few months). I like to think this is due to the fast moving world of web development, causing me to think about how my site _could_ have been done.

Recently I've started using React a lot more in work, so this time it's time to cast aside PHP and say hello to JS, in the form of Gatsby.

## The new stack

As mentioned, Gatsby and NetlifyCMS was chosen as a replacement to Grav.

For hosting, I've dropped DigitalOcean (which is great, but almost a bit too much for a simple site like mine), and I now use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). It was between this and[ Surge.sh](http://surge.sh), but the easy deployment features of Netlify really persuaded me.
